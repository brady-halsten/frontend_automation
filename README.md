# Automated Signup Testing With Selenium

This project uses **Selenium WebDriver** and **Pytest** to perform automated UI testing of a Django-based user signup and login workflow. The script dynamically generates a user, registers them, confirms registration via page navigation and screenshot, then logs the user in and verifies success.

## Features

- Automated **signup** test with form interaction
- Automated **login** test with validation

## Usage

ðŸ“¸ Screenshots for registration and login are saved automatically with timestamped filenames like:

- registration_confirmation_user_20250730123115.png

- login_confirmation_user_20250730123115.png

Terminal output will also include:

- User created
